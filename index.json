This is, of course, highly relevant if you\u0026rsquo;re enrolled in 479, but most of this applies to any RA, whether or not working for course credit. Please take a look!\nPSYC 479 – Special Research Problems in Psychology Syllabus for Language and Music Cognition Lab Research Assistants (Here\u0026rsquo;s a PDF version of the syllabus)\nLab location: BPS 3150 Instructor / Lab PI: Dr. L. Robert Slevc (he/him) – slevc@umd.edu\nCourse Description\nThis directed study will provide the opportunity to participate in behavioral and/or neuroscientific research projects in the UMD Language and Music Cognition Lab.\nThe specific projects you will be involved with will be based on your interests and background combined with the needs of current projects. Your specific responsibilities will also vary depending on the stage of the relevant research project. You might assist with behavioral, EEG, and/or MEG data collection (including preparing for participant lab visits and cleaning up afterwards), recruiting and scheduling participants, data coding, data entry, and/or assisting with data analyses. You may also be asked to perform literature searches, write reports of research findings, and write short blogposts for a general audience on recent research relevant to the lab.\nBy assisting with research in our lab, you will gain technical and theoretical research skills, interpersonal skills (by working with lab members and human participants), and skills associated with research communication and dissemination. You will also learn about procedures and policies that protect research participants. You will be a contributing member to ongoing research on the cognitive and neural processes involved in language and/or music perception and production. Student involvement in research is critical to much of the scientific work done here at Maryland and we value your commitment to maintaining the high quality of our research process. During this experience, you will learn about theory and current literature in psycholinguistics/neurolinguistics and music perception and cognition. You will also learn more generally about theories and behavioral and neuroscience methods involved in cognitive science / cognitive psychology research. We hope that your experience working in this research lab is rewarding and useful in your academic career.\nLearning Outcomes\n Master a selected bibliography of scientific literature related to your project(s) Develop research technology skills through hands on experience Develop scientific communication skills Investigate and pursue science-related career development opportunities  Supervisors\nYour primary research mentor is Dr. Slevc, the lab's PI. However, your immediate supervisor / research mentor may be a graduate student or postdoc depending on the specific projects you are working on. Research mentors will supervise your work and are available for lab-related and other questions.\nCourse Requirements\n  Hours. Enrolling for three credits commits you to 135 hours of work (an average of 9 hours/week) on the project(s) to which you are assigned. (Enrolling for two credits may also be possible, which would commit you to 90 hours, or an average of 6 hours/week.) Scheduled hours are typically flexible, although the degree of flexibility can vary by research project. In general, you should schedule your specific hours at least a week in advance, and ideally farther in advance if posting timeslots for participant signups. It is important to keep up with your hours. If research tasks are not filling these hours (e.g., because of limited participant signups or pandemic-related research restrictions) then you are expected to work with your instructor to identify other useful ways to contribute (e.g., by working on literature reviews, documenting / writing up aspects of the research, etc.) Students who fall behind in hours can make up time during finals week if necessary, depending on the availability of lab work at the end of the semester. If you get significantly behind in your hours (\u0026amp;gt;10 hours behind where you should be in the term), you should work with your supervisor to make arrangements for completing your hours on time. When running experiments: One of the most important aspects of a position in a research lab is collecting data (i.e., running experiments). It is crucial that you respect participants' time by being on time yourself and being prepared when running an experiment Your grade will be affected if you are late or miss an assigned shift (see details below in the \u0026quot;Grading\u0026quot; section).\n  Training / certifications. It is important that you understand how to protect the rights and welfare of research participants. Thus, before becoming involved in research on human participants, you should first complete an online research ethics course from the CITI program. To do this, create an account at http://www.citiprogram.org and take the online \u0026quot;Social and Behavioral Basic/Refresher\u0026quot; course (be sure to put \u0026quot;University of Maryland, College Park\u0026quot; as an affiliation). Once complete, you should turn in a copy of your completion report. If you have taken this course already (e.g., for experience in another lab) within the past three years, you need not take again. (If it has been over three years, you can take a shorter \u0026quot;refresher\u0026quot; course – contact instructor for details.) Various other training courses and/or meetings may be required depending on the specific project(s) you are involved with. These meetings will count toward your lab hours.\n  Reading assignments. You will periodically be asked to read materials related to your projects in the lab and/or about psycholinguistic / neurolinguistic research more generally. You may also be asked to read and comment on lab members' work-in-progress, workshop presentations, etc. When lab work is relatively slow (e.g., because of minimal participant signups), a good use of time is to catch up on the background reading listed below and on past published work from the lab (linked on the lab webpage).\n  Weekly lab meetings. Weekly lab meetings are required and count towards your total hours in the lab. These meetings provide opportunities to discuss ongoing research projects, giving you greater context for the projects you are working on. These also are valuable in that other lab members can get feedback from you and other lab members on their work. We also may use these meetings to discuss papers or topics of professional development. We welcome suggestions and requests for these meetings. For Spring, 2022, lab meetings are scheduled for Thursdays at 4pm.\n  Final assignment. The \u0026quot;standard\u0026quot; final assignment is to contribute at least one post to the lab's blog. This post should describe the findings of some resent research that you find interesting and is related (at least tangentially) to the lab's work (i.e., a recent primary source article about language and/or music perception/cognition). It should target an intelligent, but non-expert, audience and, ideally, should also refer to additional relevant sources. More details and some resources for this assignment are posted here. This post is due by the last day of classes (unless you ask for an extension), although you are strongly encouraged to complete this earlier in the semester so that you can present it in a lab meeting to get feedback and suggestions. If you do not wish to write and publish a blogpost, you can instead lead a lab meeting on some topic relevant to the lab. You may also negotiate some other assignment. In any case, you are encouraged to talk with your research mentor or Dr. Slevc before beginning the assignment.\n  Grading\nYour supervisors (e.g., graduate student research mentor, the lab manager, and Dr. Slevc) will evaluate your reliability, professionalism, initiative, teamwork, punctuality, positive work attitude, communication, promptness in completing tasks, thoroughness, and knowledge of job. Grades will then be assigned based on your hours completed and the quality of your work as follows:\n Completion of hours 60% Final Assignment 10% Supervisors' Evaluation 30%  Course policies and other notes\nThis course is subject to university-wide policies for undergraduate courses. These include policies on academic integrity, student conduct, sexual misconduct, discrimination, accessibility, attendance, absences, missed assignments, student rights, official UMD communications, midterm grades, complaints about final exams, copyright and intellectual property, final exams, course evaluations, and campus resources. A few other topics specific to this class:\n  Confidentiality. Data we collect is provided by our research participants with the understanding that their identity will remain confidential. Protecting participants' identity and maintaining confidentiality is critical to ethical research. As a research assistant, you may have access to confidential material and it is very important that you do not discuss this information outside the lab. Confidential lab materials should not be removed from the lab and you should not discuss participants outside of necessary discussion for research purposes.\n  Use of email and Slack for official communication. Prompt communication is essential for an efficient lab environment. You will be expected to reply to emails about lab matters or (more often) messages on the lab Slack channel within 24 hours (48 hours on weekends). Frequent delayed responses could lower your course grade.\n  Graduate school / Career planning. Any students who would like to discuss graduate school or careers in psychology are encouraged to meet with graduate students, postdocs, or Dr. Slevc for input/advice.\n  Scholarly work. We encourage students who are interested in investing time, energy, and intellectual contributions above and beyond their lab responsibilities to consider taking on their own project (or aspects of a larger project). This could lead to an honors thesis, result in presenting research locally or at national/international conferences, and even result in co-authoring publications. Please be aware that the opportunity for this level of intellectual contribution and involvement depends not only on your initiative and investment, but also on the opportunities that are currently available. Students are encouraged to consider presenting either their independent research or other (non-independent) research with which they are involved at the PSYC Undergraduate Research Day in the Spring. If you do this, we expect that you will spend lab hours working on aspects of the project. However, you should expect that planning a presentation will require effort beyond your lab hours, as this is something done for your own professional development. Students can present independently or part of a team depending on their level of experience in the lab and the type of projects available. Students often find this to be an engaging and rewarding experience and we hope you will too. There are often opportunities for summer funding to work on independent research through BSOS and through the Maryland Center for Undergraduate Research. If you are interested in pursuing these types of opportunities, please discuss with your lab supervisors.\n  Letters of recommendation. Dr. Slevc will generally write a letter of recommendation for students who have committed at least two semesters of 3-credits (or 9 hours) to the lab and have performed well. You should ask for the letter well in advance of the deadline. Please realize that the strength of a letter carries more weight than the mere presence of a letter. Factors that contribute to a stronger letter include demonstrating initiative and investment in the lab and the projects you are working on, consistent reliability and accountability in your lab hours and projects, and a strong ability to work collaboratively with lab members.\n  Illness. Please do not come into the lab if you are sick. It is better to cancel an experimental session or fall behind than to risk getting the rest of the lab (and experimental participants) sick.\n  Complaints or problems. If something is not going as well as you would like, please tell someone about it. Talk to your research mentor, the lab manager, or another lab member you feel comfortable with. The lab environment and procedures are always evolving and can always be improved, but we can only improve things if we know what isn't going well.\n  1 Often it is not possible to find a time for lab meeting where everyone is available, in which case we prioritize new lab members and lab members who were not able to meet at a lab meeting the last semester.

We implemented the Hugo Academic theme. The Academic theme uses a series of templates called \u0026ldquo;widgets\u0026rdquo; that can copied and edited as needed to build the site.\nOur website is available at: http://lmcl-umd.github.io.\nSystem Requirements: In order to edit and update the website, you must have the following installed on your machine:\n[Homebrew](https://brew.sh) [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) [Git](https://help.github.com/en/github/getting-started-with-github/set-up-git) Github Repositories: The code for our website is hosted on Github. The username for our lab\u0026rsquo;s GitHub is lmcl-umd. Contact Dr. Slevc for the password if/when needed for SSH authentication (see \u0026ldquo;Editing the Website\u0026rdquo; below). There are two repositories in which the code lives:\n websiteWork  lmcl-umd.github.io. The websiteWork repository is where the working code lives while the lmcl-umd.github.io. repository is where the live (published) code lives.\n Note: You will only ever have to change code in websiteWork and that will automatically update the live code in the lmcl-umd.github.io. repository. \nEditing/Updating the Website: In order to edit the website, you must clone the websiteWork repository from git onto your local machine. When you clone the websiteWork repository, the \u0026ldquo;public\u0026rdquo; folder from the code will also be copied onto your machine. This folder, in layman\u0026rsquo;s terms, manages the updates to the site repository. In order to clone and set up this automatic updating, you must follow the steps below:\n1. open a terminal on your computer 2. navigate to the folder/directory in which you wish to download the websiteWork repository 3. use the following command to clone the websiteWork repository onto your local machine: git clone https://github.com/lmcl-umd/websiteWork.git 4. navigate into the websiteWork directory cd websiteWork 5. completely remove the current public directory so that you may set up your own tracking to the remote repository git rm -r --cached public 6. creates a git submodule, this builds your site to public where the created public directory will have a different remote origin (i.e. hosted GitHub repository) git submodule add -b master git@github.com:lmcl-umd/lmcl-umd.github.io.git public 7. run the first build of public hugo After the website files are locally on your machine and your public directory is set up, you can make changes that will be visible both locally and on the master site. Any time you make changes in the local, websiteWork repository (any of the websiteWork files), you will follow the steps below to deploy these changes to the public repository (i.e. the website):\n1. make sure your local repository matches with the remote repository, pull any new changes git pull 2. see what changes have been made git status 3. add all these changes to git for tracking git add * 4. commit your changes to be made git commit -m \u0026#34;your commit message here\u0026#34; 5. push these changes to the local websiteWork repository git push 6. deploy these changes to the public repository (i.e. the live website) ./deploy.sh \u0026#34;Your commit message\u0026#34; This deploy command will push your edits to the lmcl-umd.github.io. repository and after a couple of minutes, your changes will appear on the live website.\nIn order to clone and push edits via git, you must first have git set up on your computer and authenticate our lmcl-umd GitHub account via your computer\u0026rsquo;s unique SSH key.\nHelpful Git Commands: # clone the repository git clone https://github.com/lmcl-umd/websiteWork.git # make sure you have the most recent version of the repository on your local machine git pull # deploy edits to lmcl-umd.github.io. repository # your commit message should describe the edits made  ./deploy.sh \u0026#34;your commit message\u0026#34; # add edits to websiteWork repository git add * # commit edits to websiteWork repository # your commit message should describe the edits made  git commit -m \u0026#34;your commit message\u0026#34; # push edits to websiteWork repository git push # see what edits you have made git staus Multiple Git Users: If there are multiple users updating the website from multiple devices, the websiteWork repository on your local machine may be out of date from time to time. To ensure that you always have the most up to date version of the website code, you must \u0026ldquo;pull\u0026rdquo; it down from the repository before you make any changes yourself.\ngit pull Read the output of this code carefully. If the word \u0026ldquo;error\u0026rdquo; or \u0026ldquo;aborting\u0026rdquo; is present after you try to pull the websiteWork repository, something went wrong. The most likely problem is that there are some untracked files between the two versions of code (the version in the repository and the version on your local machine) and git is unable to merge them. To resolve this issue, run the following two code snippets:\ngit fetch --all git reset --hard origin/master Now, you should be able to run the pull command again and successfully get an updated version of the code.\ngit pull If you are still getting errors with pushing your local websiteWork repository or delaying the public repository, I recommend just deleting the repository all together and re-cloning (and setting up the public folder) from the beginning. It is very easy for git to become complicated and its easier to just start fresh with all the commits/branches up to date, which will be the case if you re-clone from remote.\nAt this point, you can make your own changes to any of the websiteWork files and deploy, git add, git commit, and git push as you normally would.\nCode Organization: After you clone the websiteWork repository, you will see a folder called \u0026ldquo;websiteWork\u0026rdquo; on your computer. Within that folder are many, many subdirectories. The main folders most relevant for editing, however, are:\ncontent: holds all the actual editable content on the site; subdirectories within this folder are named to indicate which sections of the site they house information on config: holds the more administrative, website configuration files static: holds images and other files such as publication odds or profile cv's for reference by other folders layouts: the main back-end of the website that holds all style sheets, and design of the site  Do NOT ever edit the public folder in this repository It handles the automatic deployment to the main website and should not be edited.\nFor more information on managing and writing content see the Hugo Academic source documentation.\nMake Edits without Deploying What if you want to just play around and see how something will look before actually deploying to the website?\nWe also have a version of the website\u0026rsquo;s code (and example code) on DropBox. This code is not live and can be run locally. Enter the lmclSite folder via the terminal and then type the command\nhugo server Next open a web-browser and type\nlocalhost:1313 The code will render in the browser.\nFor access to the DropBox code, contact Dr. Slevc and you will be granted access for editing.\n","date":1557010800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1557010800,"objectID":"4697ae2b05fda60a81d09974b5ce4e00","permalink":"https://lmcl-umd.github.io./doc/example/editwebsite/","publishdate":"2019-05-05T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/doc/example/editwebsite/","section":"doc","summary":"System Design: The LMCL website is built using a Hugo website framework and hosted on Github Pages.

Given the diversity of music and language around the globe, how these are acquired during childhood is revealing about the feedback loop between our biological predispositions and exposure. Evidence suggests that children begin as generalists and become specialists, with music and language deeply entangled in infancy and modularity emerging over time. In addition, development proceeds along parallel tracks, with comparable cognitive milestones. Although there is a tendency to celebrate our precociousness, it may be that we should really extol the slow and protected aspects of development: our unfledged entry into the world affords us the extended time necessary to internalize these products of culture. The present chapter begins by exploring the variety of music and languages around the world. It then tracks developmental milestones from birth throughout childhood, examines linked developmental disorders, and closes with a discussion of open questions and future directions.","tags":["music and language","music","language acquisition","musical development"],"title":"Music and language: Milestones of development","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Brooke M.

Past research has used various tasks; most commonly assessing perceptual skills (e.g., same/different judgments in sequentially presented melodies), but also sometimes production tasks (e.g., singing a series of pitches or tapping along with a musical sequence). Outcome measures have ranged from single indices (e.g., \"pitch ability\") to composite scores from multiple tasks (e.g., pitch, rhythm, loudness, timbre, etc.). To date, it remains unclear how these different measures/scores relate to one another, limiting the ability to generalize across tasks and results. To address these issues, we assessed 165 participants' performance on 15 representative musical ability tasks to model the unity and diversity of musical abilities.

These group comparisons presume to capture relatively stable cognitive traits and have revealed important insights about the architecture of the language processing system that could not have been gleaned from studying monolinguals alone. However, there are drawbacks to using a groupcomparison, or Traits, approach. In this theoretical review, we outline some limitations of treating executive functions as stable traits and of treating bilinguals as a uniform group when comparing to monolinguals. To build on what we have learned from group comparisons, we advocate for an emerging complementary approach to the question of cognition and bilingualism. Using an approach that compares bilinguals to themselves under different linguistic or cognitive contexts allows researchers to ask questions about how language and cognitive processes interact based on dynamically fluctuating cognitive and neural states. A States approach, which has already been used by bilingualism researchers, allows for cause-and-effect hypotheses and shifts our focus from questions of group differences to questions of how varied linguistic environments influence cognitive operations in the moment and how fluctuations in cognitive engagement impact language processing.","tags":["bilingualism","executive function","language processing","individual differences","cognitive control"],"title":"Moving from bilingual traits to states: Understanding cognition and language processing through moment-to-moment variation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Andrés Buxó-Lugo","L.

We first investigate whether descending minor third intervals are more prevalent in sad speech compared to other types of emotional speech, as has been reported previously. In these data, we see no evidence for descending minor thirds being characteristic of sad speech.

The efficiency of auditory object recognition belies the critical constraint that acoustic stimuli necessarily require time to unfold. Using magentoencephalography (MEG), we studied the time course of the neural processes that transform dynamic acoustic information into auditory object representations. Participants listened to a diverse set of 36 tokens comprising everyday sounds from a typical human environment. Multivariate pattern analysis was used to decode the sound tokens from the MEG recordings. We show that sound tokens can be decoded from brain activity beginning 90 milliseconds after stimulus onset with peak decoding performance occurring at 155 milliseconds post stimulus onset. Decoding performance was primarily driven by differences between category representations (e.g., environmental vs. instrument sounds), although within-category decoding was better than chance. Representational similarity analysis revealed that these emerging neural representations were related to harmonic and spectrotemporal differences among the stimuli, which correspond to canonical acoustic features processed by the auditory pathway. Our findings begin to link the processing of physical sound properties with the perception of auditory objects and events in cortex.","tags":["Auditory","Magnetoencephalography","Multivariate Pattern Analysis","Object Perception","Representational Similarity Analysis"],"title":"The rapid emergence of auditory object representations in cortex reflect central acoustic attributes","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yasmeen Faroqi-Shah","L.

One specific proposal suggests cognitive control plays a key role when a listener confronts unexpected or irregular musical information. Methods: In two experiments, we simultaneously manipulated musical tonal contexts and non-musical cognitive control engagement. Experiment 1 used a 2-back tone-matching task with lures (engaging both cognitive control and working memory) and Experiment 2 used a Stroop task performed in a harmonic priming paradigm. Results: In Experiment 1, participants had difficulty overcoming conflict from lure trials, especially when tone frequencies occupied an irregular tonal context. However, in Experiment 2, the harmonic priming manipulation did not affect Stroop-conflict performance. Discussion: We interpret these results in terms of conflict monitoring and conflict resolution.

What acoustic features support a listener’s ability to differentiate the great variety of natural sounds they might encounter? Studies of auditory object perception typically examine identification (and confusion) responses or dissimilarity ratings between pairs of objects and events. However, the majority of this prior work has been conducted within single categories of sound. This separation has precluded a broader understanding of the general acoustic attributes that govern auditory object and event perception within and across different behaviorally relevant sound classes. The present experiments take a broader approach by examining multiple categories of sound relative to one another. This approach bridges critical gaps in the literature and allows us to identify (and assess the relative importance of) features that are useful for distinguishing sounds within, between and across behaviorally relevant sound categories. To do this, we conducted behavioral sound identification (Experiment 1) and dissimilarity rating (Experiment 2) studies using a broad set of stimuli that leveraged the acoustic variability within and between different sound categories via a diverse set of 36 sound tokens (12 utterances from different speakers, 12 instrument timbres, and 12 everyday objects from a typical human environment). Multidimensional scaling solutions as well as analyses of item-pair-level responses as a function of different acoustic qualities were used to understand what acoustic features informed participants’ responses. In addition to the spectral and temporal envelope qualities noted in previous work, listeners’ dissimilarity ratings were associated with spectrotemporal variability and aperiodicity. Subsets of these features (along with fundamental frequency variability) were also useful for making specific within or between sound category judgments. Dissimilarity ratings largely paralleled sound identification performance, however the results of these tasks did not completely mirror one another. In addition, musical training was related to improved sound identification performance.","tags":["auditory object","acoustics","timbre","speaker identification","environmental sounds"],"title":"Acoustic correlates of auditory object and event perception: Speakers, musical timbres and environmental sounds","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mattson Ogg","Dustin Moraczewski","Stefanie E.

Understanding how this impressive ability is accomplished can improve signal processing and machine intelligence applications along with assistive listening technologies. However, it is not clear how the brain represents the many sounds that humans can recognize (such as speech and music) at the level of individual sources, categories and acoustic features. To examine the cortical organization of these representations, we used patterns of fMRI responses to decode 1) four individual speakers and instruments from one another (separately, within each category), 2) the superordinate category labels associated with each stimulus (speech or instrument), and 3) a set of simple synthesized sounds that could be differentiated entirely on their acoustic features. Data were collected using an interleaved silent steady state sequence to increase the temporal signal-to-noise ratio, and mitigate issues with auditory stimulus presentation in fMRI. Largely separable clusters of voxels in the temporal lobes supported the decoding of individual speakers and instruments from other stimuli in the same category. Decoding the superordinate category of each sound was more accurate and involved a larger portion of the temporal lobes. However, these clusters all overlapped with areas that could decode simple, acoustically separable stimuli. Thus, individual sound sources from different sound categories are represented in separate regions of the temporal lobes that are situated within regions implicated in more general acoustic processes. These results bridge an important gap in our understanding of cortical representations of sounds and their acoustics.","tags":["fMRI","auditory objects","auditory perception","speaker identification","speech","timbre"],"title":"Separable neural representations of sound sources: Speaker identity and musical timbres","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Mattson Ogg","L.

At the root of this interest is concern over the reproducibility of key findings. A variety of large-scale replication attempts have revealed that a number of previously published effects cannot be reproduced, while other analyses indicate that the published literature is rife with underpowered studies and publication bias. These revelations suggest that it is time to change how psychological science is carried out and increase transparency of reporting. We argue change will be slow until institutions adopt new procedures for evaluating scholarly activity. We consider three actions that individuals and departments can take to facilitate change throughout psychological science. These three actions are the development of individualized research philosophy statements, the creation of an annotated curriculum vitae to improve the transparency of scholarly reporting, and the use of a formal evaluative system that explicitly captures behaviors that support reproducibility. Our recommendations build on proposals for open science by enabling researchers to have a voice in articulating (and contextualizing) how they would like their work to be evaluated and by providing a mechanism for more detailed and transparent reporting of scholarly activities.","tags":["open science","reproducibility","research philosophy","annotated curriculum vitae"],"title":"Making research evaluation more transparent: Aligning research philosophy, institutional values, and reporting","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"23d1e75f872528fc12f5f2b142375ff7","permalink":"https://lmcl-umd.github.io./publications/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publications/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Publications","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c6625328e7b2e36b114847f299065f54","permalink":"https://lmcl-umd.github.io./resources/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/resources/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Resources","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"","date":1546300800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1546300800,"objectID":"c1d17ff2b20dca0ad6653a3161942b64","permalink":"https://lmcl-umd.github.io./people/","publishdate":"2019-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/people/","section":"","summary":"","tags":null,"title":"Who are we","type":"widget_page"},{"authors":["Hao Yan","Randi C.

Some have suggested that abstract syntactic priming (i.e., with no lexical overlap) derives from implicit learning, whereas the lexical boost derives from explicit short-term memory (STM) for the prime (e.g., Chang, Dell, \u0026 Bock, 2006). To address this issue, we assessed twelve people with aphasia (PWA) with varying degrees of STM and language deficits and eleven age-matched healthy control speakers in a syntactic priming experiment. Despite the PWA's difficulty in maintaining phonological, semantic, and structural information, as evidenced by various STM and sentence repetition measures, they showed lexical boost effects comparable to those of healthy speakers. Moreover, the size of the lexical boost was unrelated to the degree of STM deficit, suggesting that the lexical boost does not rely on explicit memory. Alternative explanations for the differing patterns for syntactic priming with and without lexical overlap are discussed.","tags":["Syntactic priming","Lexical boost","sentence production","language production","short-term memory","implicit learning","aphasia"],"title":"Lexical overlap increases syntactic priming in aphasia independently of short-term memory abilities: Evidence against the explicit memory account of the lexical boost","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor S.

One such aspect of cognition that may be related to musical training is executive functions (EFs), a set of top-down processes that regulate behavior and cognition according to task demands. Previous studies investigating the link between musical training and EFs have yielded mixed results and are difficult to compare. In part, this is because most studies have looked at only one specific cognitive process, and even studies looking at the same process have used different experimental tasks. Furthermore, most correlational studies have used different “musician” and “non-musician” categorizations for their comparisons, so generalizing the findings is difficult. The present study provides a more comprehensive assessment of how individual differences in musical training relate to latent measures of three separable aspects of EFs. We administered a well-validated EF battery containing multiple tasks tapping the EF components of inhibition, shifting, and working memory updating (Friedman et al. in Journal of Experimental Psychology: General, 137, 201–225, 2008), as well as a comprehensive, continuous measure of musical training and sophistication (Müllensiefen et al., in PLoS ONE, 9, e89642, 2014). Musical training correlated with some individual EF tasks involving inhibition and working memory updating, but not with individual tasks involving shifting. However, musical training only predicted the latent variable of working memory updating, but not the latent variables of inhibition or shifting after controlling for IQ, socioeconomic status, and handedness. Although these data are correlational, they nonetheless suggest that musical experience places particularly strong demands specifically on working memory updating processes.","tags":["musical training","executive functions","latent variable analysis","individual differences"],"title":"Individual differences in musical training and Executive Functions: A latent variable approach","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Shota Momma","L.

Lee and Thompson 2004, J. Lee and Thompson 2011, McAllister et al. 2009). Given this body of evidence, it is reasonable to assume, as we do here, that this distinction is directly relevant to psycholinguistic theorizing. However, especially in production, exactly how this distinction affects processing is unknown, beyond the suggestion that unaccusatives somehow involve more complex processing than unergatives (see J. Lee and Thompson 2011). Here we examine how real-time planning processes in production differ for unaccusatives and unergatives. We build on previous studies on lookahead effects in sentence planning that show that verbs are planned before a deep object is uttered but not before a deep subject is uttered (Momma, Slevc, and Phillips 2015, 2016). (We use terms like deep subject in a theory-neutral fashion, with no intended commitment to a specific syntactic encoding.)

Participants heard speech, musical instrument, and human-environmental sounds ranging from 12.5 to 200 ms in duration. Listeners could reliably identify sound categories with just 25 ms of duration. In experiment 1, participants' performance on instrument sounds showed a distinct processing advantage at shorter durations. Experiment 2 revealed that this advantage was largely dependent on regularities in instrument onset characteristics relative to the spectrotemporal complexity of environmental sounds and speech. Models of participant responses indicated that listeners used spectral, temporal, noise, and pitch cues in the task. Aspects of spectral centroid were associated with responses for all categories, while noisiness and spectral flatness were associated with environmental and instrument responses, respectively.

Musical ability predicted better performance on both auditory and visual updating tasks, even when controlling for a variety of potential confounds (age, handedness, bilingualism, and socio-economic status). However, musical ability was not clearly related to inhibitory control and was unrelated to switching performance. These data thus show that cognitive advantages associated with musical ability are not limited to auditory processes, but are limited to specific aspects of EF. This supports a process-specific (but modality-general) relationship between musical ability and non-musical aspects of cognition.","tags":["Executive functions","Working memory","Musical

However, the most direct experimental test of this hypothesis (Schriefers, Teruel, \u0026 Meinshausen, 1998) found no evidence for advance verb selection in verb-final (subject-verb and subject-object-verb) utterances in German. The current study, based on a multiword picture-word interference task (Meyer, 1996; Schriefers et al., 1998), demonstrates that in Japanese, a strongly verb-final language, verbs are indeed planned in advance, but selectively before object noun articulation and not before subject noun articulation. This contrasting pattern of advance verb selection may reconcile the motivation for advance verb selection in structural encoding while explaining the previous failures to demonstrate it.

Auditory agnosia can be general, affecting all types of sound perception, or can be (relatively) specific to a particular domain. Verbal auditory agnosia (also known as (pure) word deafness) refers to deficits specific to speech processing, environmental sound agnosia refers to difficulties confined to non-speech environmental sounds, and amusia refers to deficits confined to music. These deficits can be apperceptive, affecting basic perceptual processes, or associative, affecting the relation of a perceived auditory object to its meaning. This chapter discusses what is known about the behavioral symptoms and lesion correlates of these different types of auditory agnosia (focusing especially on verbal auditory agnosia), evidence for the role of a rapid temporal processing deficit in some aspects of auditory agnosia, and the few attempts to treat the perceptual deficits associated with auditory agnosia. A clear picture of auditory agnosia has been slow to emerge, hampered by the considerable heterogeneity in behavioral deficits, associated brain damage, and variable assessments across cases. Despite this lack of clarity, these striking deficits in complex sound processing continue to inform our understanding of auditory perception and cognition.","tags":["amusia","auditory agnosia","environmental sound agnosia","pure word deafness","rapid temporal processing","speech perception deficits"],"title":"Auditory Agnosia","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

According to this resource-sharing framework, music and language rely on separable syntactic representations but recruit shared cognitive resources to integrate these representations into evolving structures. The SSIRH is supported by findings of interactions between structural manipulations in music and language. However, other recent evidence suggests that such interactions also can arise with nonstructural manipulations, and some recent neuroimaging studies report largely nonoverlapping neural regions involved in processing musical and linguistic structure. These conflicting results raise the question of exactly what shared (and distinct) resources underlie musical and linguistic structural processing. This paper suggests that one shared resource is prefrontal cortical mechanisms of cognitive control, which are recruited to detect and resolve conflict that occurs when expectations are violated and interpretations must be revised. By this account, musical processing involves not just the incremental processing and integration of musical elements as they occur, but also the incremental generation of musical predictions and expectations, which must sometimes be overridden and revised in light of evolving musical input.","tags":["music and language","Syntax","Cognitive control","Musical ambiguity"],"title":"Processing structure in language and music: a case for shared reliance on cognitive control","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Alison Shell","Jared Linck","L.

The current study investigates these issues by experimentally manipulating demand on inhibitory control using a picture word interference task during a language switching paradigm.

We examined this question by studying whether semantic similarity in language relates to the brain's organization of object representations in inferior temporal cortex (ITC), an area of the brain at the crux of several proposals describing how the brain might represent conceptual knowledge. Semantic relationships among words can be viewed as a geometrical structure with some pairs of words close in their meaning (e.g., man and boy) and other pairs more distant (e.g., man and tomato). ITC's representation of objects similarly can be viewed as a complex structure with some pairs of stimuli evoking similar patterns of activation (e.g., man and boy) and other pairs evoking very different patterns (e.g., man and tomato). In this study, we examined whether the geometry of visual object representations in ITC bears a correspondence to the geometry of semantic relationships between word labels used to describe the objects. We compared ITC's representation to semantic structure, evaluated by explicit ratings of semantic similarity and by five computational measures of semantic similarity. We show that the representational geometry of ITC—but not of earlier visual areas (V1)—is reflected both in explicit behavioral ratings of semantic similarity and also in measures of semantic similarity derived from word usage patterns in natural language. Our findings show that patterns of brain activity in ITC not only reflect the organization of visual information into objects but also represent objects in a format compatible with conceptual thought and language.","tags":["vision","language","representational similarity analysis","fMRI"],"title":"The emergence of semantic meaning in the ventral temporal pathway","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

If an erroneous and corrected sentence fragment is discarded, then the original form of an ultimately transitive utterance should not influence future production. However, if the syntactic parse of an error is not discarded, then it should influence speakers’ subsequent choice of syntactic structure. In both experiments, structural priming was signifi- cantly reduced when primes were corrected to a non-dative structure (relative to disfluent but ultimately dative primes). However, target descriptions did show an influence from corrected errors when the prime and target shared the same verb.

Music, while recognized as a human universal, is often treated as an ancillary ability – one dependent on or derivative of language. In contrast, we argue that it is more productive from a developmental perspective to describe spoken language as a special type of music. A review of existing studies presents a compelling case that musical hearing and ability is essential to language acquisition. In addition, we challenge the prevailing view that music cognition matures more slowly than language and is more difficult; instead, we argue that music learning matches the speed and effort of language acquisition. We conclude that music merits a central place in our understanding of human development.","tags":["music and language","language acquisition","childhood development","musical development","music cognition","definition of music"],"title":"Music and early language acquisition","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

Three experiments investigated speakers’ tendency to produce syntactic structures that allow for early production of material that is accessible in memory. In Experiment 1, speakers produced accessible information early less often when under a verbal WM load than when under no load. Experiment 2 found the same pattern for given-new ordering (i.e., when accessibility was manipulated by making information given). Experiment 3 addressed the possibility that these effects do not reflect WM mechanisms but rather increased task difficulty by relying on the distinction between verbal and spatial WM: Speakers’ tendency to produce sentences respecting given-new ordering was reduced more by a verbal than by a spatial WM load. These patterns show that accessibility effects do in fact reflect accessibility in verbal WM and that representations in sentence production are vulnerable to interference from other information in memory.","tags":["language production","grammatical encoding","working memory","accessibility effects","similarity-based interference"],"title":"Saying what's on your mind: Working memory effects on sentence production","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

One way to investigate the cognitive and neural underpinnings of speech perception is by investigating patients with speech perception deficits but with preserved ability in other domains of language. One such case is reported here: patient NL shows highly impaired speech perception despite normal hearing ability and preserved semantic knowledge, speaking, and reading ability, and is thus classified as a case of pure word deafness (PWD). NL has a left temporoparietal lesion without right hemisphere damage and DTI imaging suggests that he has preserved cross-hemispheric connectivity, arguing against an account of PWD as a disconnection of left lateralized language areas from auditory input. Two experiments investigated whether NL's speech perception deficit could instead result from an underlying problem with rapid temporal processing. Experiment 1 showed that NL has particular difficulty discriminating sounds that differ in terms of rapid temporal changes, be they speech or non-speech sounds. Experiment 2 employed an intensive training program designed to improve rapid temporal processing in language impaired children (Fast ForWord; Scientific Learning Corporation, Oakland, CA) and found that NL was able to improve his ability to discriminate rapid temporal differences in non-speech sounds, but not in speech sounds. Overall, these data suggest that patients with unilateral PWD may, in fact, have a deficit in (left lateralized) temporal processing ability, however they also show that a rapid temporal processing deficit is, by itself, unable to account for this patient's speech perception deficit.","tags":["Speech perception","Rapid temporal processing","Pure word deafness","Lateralization"],"title":"Speech perception, rapid temporal processing, and the left hemisphere: A case study of unilateral pure word deafness","type":"publication"},{"authors":["L.

The present experiments address this issue by simultaneously manipulating syntactic processing demands in language and music. Participants performed self-paced reading of garden path sentences, in which structurally unexpected words cause temporary syntactic processing difficulty. A musical chord accompanied each sentence segment, with the resulting sequence forming a coherent chord progression. When structurally unexpected words were paired with harmonically unexpected chords, participants showed substantially enhanced garden path effects. No such interaction was observed when the critical words violated semantic expectancy or when the critical chords violated timbral expectancy. These results support a prediction of the shared syntactic integration resource hypothesis (Patel, 2003), which suggests that music and language draw on a common pool of limited processing resources for integrating incoming elements into syntactic structures.

The current paper presents data on a different type of agreement: agreement in notional/conceptual gender between genitive pronouns and their antecedents.

L2 ability was assessed in four domains: receptive phonology, productive phonology, syntax, and lexical knowledge. Also assessed were various other factors that might explain individual differences in L2 ability, including age of L2 immersion, patterns of language use and exposure, and phonological short-term memory. Hierarchical regression analyses were conducted to determine if musical ability explained any unique variance in each domain of L2 ability after controlling for other relevant factors. Musical ability predicted L2 phonological ability (both receptive and productive) even when controlling for other factors, but did not explain unique variance in L2 syntax or lexical knowledge. These results suggest that musical skills may facilitate the acquisition of L2 sound structure and add to a growing body of evidence linking language and music.","tags":["Musical ability","Individual differences","Second language acquisition"],"title":"Individual differences in second-language proficiency: Does musical ability matter?","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joseph P.

This study documents the speech sound development of non-verbal and minimally verbal children with autism.

To test the perceptual loop monitor, speakers named pictures and sometimes attempted to halt speech in response to auditory (Experiments 1 and 3) or visual (Experiments 2, 4, and 5) words that differed from the picture name. These stop-signal words were varied in terms of their semantic or phonological similarity to the intended word. The ability to halt word production was sensitive to phonological similarity and, in Experiment 5, to emotional valence, but not to semantic similarity. These results suggest that the perceptual loop detects errors by making comparisons at a level where phonological knowledge is represented. These data also imply that dialogue, back channeling, and other areas where speech production is affected by simultaneous comprehension may operate based on phonological comparisons.","tags":["Self monitoring","Perceptual loop theory","Speech errors"],"title":"Halting in single word production: A test of the perceptual loop theory of speech monitoring","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Victor S.Ferreira","L.

This suggests that comprehension processes can sometimes detect linguistic-ambiguity before producing it. However, once produced, speakers consistently avoided using the same linguistically ambiguous expression again for a different meaning. This suggests that production processes can successfully detect linguistic-ambiguity after-the-fact. Speakers almost always avoided nonlinguistic-ambiguity.
